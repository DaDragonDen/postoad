# Postoad
A tool that lets Discord server admins easily post to Bluesky without sharing the account password.

## Why use Postoad?
To protect the security of your account, you shouldn't share passwords with your team. If you share them, you risk your account being moderated or deleted. Someone posts some bullshit on behalf of YOU and your reputation is in shambles.

Postoad uses an app password provided by Bluesky, which restricts the ability to delete your account. It's different from your account password because you can easily revoke it. 

## Features
* Manage posts and reply to the community from Discord.
* Approve posts before they are released.
* Automatically post text and media from a Discord channel.
* Like and repost Bluesky posts from Discord.
* Optionally require 2FA to interact with accounts.

## Security considerations
* App passwords are encrypted with a server-wide password. This means that Da Dragon Den, Beastslash, or any other Postoad server host cannot see your app passwords. If a database breach happens, the malicious actor will only get encrypted passwords.
* Only your server ID, required channel IDs, authorized user IDs, and encrypted passwords are saved to the database â€” nothing else.
* If a server administrator forgets their 2FA method, they can only reset the account by deleting the app password and adding it back to the bot. This protects your social accounts from unauthorized Discord server administrators.
* By default, only server administrators can modify bot settings. Permissions can be changed in the bot's settings.
